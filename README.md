# VideoCoder
### A Max standalone (and editable patch) for video coding 

## How to Use VideoCoder:
This software assigns a blank dataset of [n] values per second for the length of a video file. Number-codes can then be added which allow a video to be marked in real time for further analysis. The data can be stored, edited and viewed from a CSV file.

1. Load a video (& opt. Choose colours for video codes using the menu on the bottom right)

2. Turn on recording mode (click the button or press the R key)

3. Play the video (using transport button or press space bar)

4. Add codes in real time using number keys (keys 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 will be assigned codes 1-10)

5. View, edit or save data using the buttons on the bottom right

NOTE:  Currently the colour bar cannot be exported as an image, though you can view it by choosing  "More Actions>View Colour Bar" on the bottom right, and then using this window to take a screenshot of the visualised data.

# Requirements
The standalone app is only compatible with Mac OS. 

The original patches are included here, and can run on Mac OS and Windows with Max 7 (older versions may also work, but have not been tested).
